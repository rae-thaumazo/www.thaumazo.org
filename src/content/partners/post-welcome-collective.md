The Welcome Collective is a registered Canadian charity that assists newcomers, especially refugee claimants in precarious situations. They reduce the stress and isolation faced by these individuals by providing essential goods like furniture, clothing, and household items, and by connecting them with local volunteers who offer practical information and social service guidance.
